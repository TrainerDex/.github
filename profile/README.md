> Dear everyone in TrainerDex Community,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well, although I regret to bring you some unfortunate news. 
> 
> Since [@TurnrDev](https://github.com/TurnrDev)'s announcement about TrainerDex's closure, we've been working to explore options to keep it running, improve its features, and expand its availability to more servers. However, our efforts hit a setback when Niantic implemented a significant nerf to remote raids. This not only impacted the game but also had far-reaching effects on Discord communities, leading to the closure of other great platforms like Silph and PokeMiners.
> 
> After careful consideration, we have reached a difficult decision. We will be winding down TrainerDex, and this process will be completed on 31 December 2023.
