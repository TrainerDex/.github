Hi everyone, 

Hope you're well! I have a few things I would like to mention.

Before we start, I'd like to mention monthly donation amount has taken a massive increase thanks to Wynaut Wyandotte. Thank you :heart: 

## The future of TrainerDex on Discord
As some of you may be aware, Discord are changing the way bots interact with the platform. From April 2021, bots will be unable to see messages unless specifically mentioned or they've been approved for the new Messages intent. _What does this mean for us?_ Well, the current iteration of TrainerDex Bot needs to read messages for command processing on OCR. 

Going forward, we need to rewrite all our commands to support the new [slash commands system][1]. Unfortunately, OCR processing is going to take a hit too. From April 2021, you will need to tag the bot in your images to request OCR. This is fine on Android, but iOS seems to be unable to tag from the share dialog. More details on the solution will be coming later in the year. 

Since we're rewriting the bot, we will be providing an **Public Beta Test** of the new bot. This PBT will be provided without guarantee - meaning that features will be added and removed on a regular basis. The Public Beta Test should open in a few weeks, please follow the [#pbt-news][2] channel on the official TrainerDex server for updates. Feedback and Suggestions are highly welcome, please visit [#general][3] in the [TrainerDex Development][4] server.

## The future of TrainerDex outside Discord
WE'RE MAKING AN ANDROID APP.
It's pending approval on [Google Play Store][5], but once that's ready, I'll update this message with details.
